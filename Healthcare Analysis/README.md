2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – examined disease distribution, recovery outcomes, vaccination uptake.  
3. **Revenue Insights** – analyzed sales by disease type, payment method, and state.  
4. **Patient Satisfaction** – explored survey ratings by disease and recovery status.

##  Key Insights  
- **Disease Trends:** Malaria and Tuberculosis were the most common diseases.  
- **Vaccination:** Patients who were vaccinated showed better recovery outcomes than those not vaccinated.  
- **Revenue:** NHIS and cash were the most used payment methods; revenue varied significantly across diseases.  
- **Satisfaction:** Average survey ratings were lower among deceased patients, highlighting gaps in care quality.
