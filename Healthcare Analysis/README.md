# 🏥 Healthcare Analysis  

## 📌 Problem  
A healthcare organization wants to analyze patient records to understand disease distribution, vaccination uptake, treatment outcomes, and financial performance across different states. This analysis will support better healthcare service delivery, optimize vaccination programs, and enhance patient satisfaction.

## 📂 Data Description  
The dataset contains 550 rows of patient-level health and financial information, including:  
- **Demographics:** Patient Name, Gender, Age, State  
- **Medical Records:** Disease type, Vaccination Status, Recovery Status  
- **Healthcare Usage:** Clinic Visits, Medicine Purchased  
- **Finance:** Total Sales (₦), Payment Method  
- **Feedback:** Survey Rating

## 🔎 Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values in Survey Rating, standardized Vaccination Status.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – examined disease distribution, recovery outcomes, vaccination uptake.  
3. **Revenue Insights** – analyzed sales by disease type, payment method, and state.  
4. **Patient Satisfaction** – explored survey ratings by disease and recovery status.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Disease Trends:** Malaria and Tuberculosis were the most common diseases.  
- **Vaccination:** Patients who were vaccinated showed better recovery outcomes than those not vaccinated.  
- **Revenue:** NHIS and cash were the most used payment methods; revenue varied significantly across diseases.  
- **Satisfaction:** Average survey ratings were lower among deceased patients, highlighting gaps in care quality.
