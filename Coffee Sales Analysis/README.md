# ☕ Coffee Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee shop sales data to uncover revenue trends, top-performing coffee types, and customer purchase patterns across different time periods.

###  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft Excel

###  Key Insights
- **Peak Sales Hours:** Most purchases occur between 8 AM and 11 AM — aligning with morning coffee rush hours.  
- **Best Performing Products:** Cappuccino and Latte drive the highest revenue.  
- **Revenue Trend:** Revenue peaks mid-week (Tuesday to Thursday), with weekends showing a dip.  
- **Payment Types:** Digital payments dominate over cash transactions.

### Recommendations
- Offer early-morning discounts or combo deals to capture the morning rush.
- Promote underperforming drinks (like Mocha or Espresso) through loyalty points or sampling.
- Expand mobile/digital payment options for faster checkouts.
- Introduce a weekday subscription plan for regular customers.
