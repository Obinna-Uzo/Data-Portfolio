## Project Brief
Efficient inventory management Inventory management is critically important for balancing supply and demand while minimising costs. This project explores key aspects such as
stock levels, supplier performance, warehouse utilisation, and reorder strategies. I conducted this project to identify trends, optimise restocking, and assess cost efficiency using SQL queries. Through this project, I have applied various SQL techniques and commands including Joins, Common Table Expressions(CTEs), Aggregations etc to extract meaningful insights from the data. 

### Objective: 
- To analyze stock and inventory levels, supplier and restocking performance, cost and pricing using the Inventory Management Dataset;
- Improve query readability, optimize performance and explore business strategies.

## Approach
- Queried Inventory Management Dataset with SQL analyze stock  and inventory levels, supplier and restocking performance, cost and pricing.
- Visualized some of the queries using excel for more context.
- Provided insights that could inform which products to prioritize for restocking, which suppliers to monitor, how to prepare for seasonal demand, and where costs are concentrated. 
- Apply Entity-Relationship Modelling to visually represent how tables relate in the database
- Apply Joins, CTEs, Aggregations etc for meaningful insights.

## Insights
Here are the few insights generated; 
- The Home & Garden category holds the highest total stock across all product categories.
- 262 products currently have stock quantities below their reorder point showing a potential restocking need.
- With SUP041 being the supplier with the highest average lead time of 17.3 days for restocking followed closely by SUP020 with 16.7 days, I went further to review several suppliers showing lead times ranging from 15 to 17 days.
- The average time since the last restock for products marked Out of Stock is about 234 days a key indicator of delay.
-  When assessing restock frequency, May had the most restocked products, indicating seasonal trends.
- I also found the top five most expensive products; Products 1411 and 563 which falls under the Home & Garden category followed by Products 3416, 4810 and 781 under the Office Supplies, Electronics and Books categories respectively.
