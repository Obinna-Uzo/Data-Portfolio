# Banking Data Analysis

##  Problem
A bank wants to analyze a comprehensive banking dataset that simulates internal transaction data used by financial institutions to understand customer behaviour, optimize services, and inform strategic planning.

---

##  Data Description
This dataset contains 20,000 enriched financial transactions across products like checking accounts, loans, mortgages, and card payments. Each record is embedded with detailed attributes such as:
- Customer income brackets and credit scores
- Transaction types, fees, and amounts
- Branch location and transaction channels (ATM, Mobile, Branch)
- Segment classification and recommended financial offers

---

The goal is to extract patterns, segment behaviours, and revenue drivers that banks use to:
- Improve personalization
- Assess customer risk and profitability
- Refine marketing campaigns
- Optimize branch and channel performance

---

##  Tools & Skills

##  Key Insights
Here are a few insights the dashboard uncovered:

###  Customer Insights

- 8,025 customers analyzed, with an average monthly income of €5,454

- Top transaction channel: Mobile, closely followed by Branch & Online

- Customer ID 4239 stood out with €69,209 in transaction volume across 7 transactions

- Highest credit activity in the 300–579 score range (10,060 transactions)

###  Executive View

- Over €101M in total transaction volume across 20,000 transactions

- Late payment fees generated the most revenue: €333,088, followed by insurance and credit card fees

- Unfortunately, fee revenues dropped sharply YoY, with -60% declines across the board — a clear signal for further executive review

###  Regional Analysis

- Barcelona led all cities with €13M in transaction value

- Malaga and Murcia followed closely, each crossing €12.8M

- These hotspots reveal strategic zones for deeper financial engagement or campaign targeting.

##  Impact
This analysis will help the bank to:
