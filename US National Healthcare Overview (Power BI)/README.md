### My submission for Onyx Data hashtag#DataDNA Challenge. 
For this challenge, I worked with real hospital data from 10 hospitals across the United States involving 55,500 patients to look out for trends in admissions, billing, conditions, demographics, and more.

## Here are a few insights I uncovered:

- Middle-aged adults (40-59) represent the largest share of hospital admissions, followed by young adults (20-39). Female patients outnumber males, and blood types A+ and O+ are the most commonly admitted.

- Chronic conditions dominate: Diabetes, Hypertension, and Obesity are the most diagnosed across all age groups — highlighting ongoing public health challenges.

- Admission type (Elective, Urgent, Emergency) shows minimal impact on the average length of hospital stay. Regardless of how patients arrive, their stay averages around 15.5 days.

- Despite hospital location, treatment costs remain fairly stable — averaging $25,500 per patient. Geography appears to have little influence on billing variations.

- Treatment costs exceed $25K on average, regardless of insurance provider. Medications such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Lipitor, and Paracetamol are evenly distributed across conditions, emphasizing standardized treatment approaches.

 - Patient admissions rose by 7.5% in 2024, adding 3,854 more cases compared to the previous years. Interestingly, average billing and length of stay remained stable despite the increase in patients.

- Top U.S. hospitals like Cedars-Sinai, Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins handle the highest patient loads while maintaining consistent billing and test result patterns.
